bitstarter
==========
This is code for my Coursera.org "Startup Engineering" Bitstarter website class project.  The web app is written in Node.js, jQuery, HTML5, and Twitter Bootstrap styles and is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance and on Heroku.com.  

Node.js makes it possible to asynchronously retrieve and parse data for a truly interactive and real-time user experience. Using CSS media queries and HTML5 allows the app to responsively resize to the appropriate viewing size for any computer screen or handheld device.  

Interactive components of the site include social buttons for Twitter and Facebook, Bitcoin monetisation, and Google Analytics for tracking.

Web app development proceeds within a Github 3-stage flow of development branch -> staging branch -> production branch.  Development is done directly on an AWS EC2 server instance; staging and production are hosted on seperate, dedicated Heroku instances.

With this project I intend to master a disciplined approach to application development with the consistent use of Github branching, gain experience deploying web applications to the cloud, and attain a deep understanding of the asynchronous properties of Node.js.  

If I manage, in the process, to convince a few people to eat vegan more often, increase publicity for vegan recipe blog-writers, and raise some money to donate to the Tierheim (animal shelter) in Berlin, using a business model that is self-sustaining... then I can consider my endeavors to be a huge success.
